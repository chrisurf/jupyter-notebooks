{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Writing a Blog with LM Studio\n","\n","This notebook demonstrates how to connect to a local Language Model (LM) Studio server and use it to generate content for a blog. The process involves leveraging advanced AI techniques to streamline blog creation, ensuring high-quality and coherent content.\n","\n","Key Features:\n","\n","1. **Connecting to LM Studio**: Learn how to establish a connection with your local LM Studio server, enabling seamless communication between your notebook and the AI model.\n","\n","2. **Content Generation**: Use the powerful capabilities of LM Studio to generate detailed and engaging blog content based on a given topic. The AI assists in creating structured outlines and filling in the sections with well-written text.\n","\n","3. **Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning**: Incorporate the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, which breaks down complex problem-solving tasks into a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps. This technique ensures that the generated content follows a logical progression, mimicking human-like step-by-step thought processes. CoT enhances the coherence and depth of the blog by ensuring that each section is thoughtfully developed.\n","\n","4. **Refinement and Proofreading**: Automatically refine and proofread the generated content to ensure clarity, grammatical correctness, and overall quality.\n","\n","5. **SEO Optimization**: Optimize the blog content for search engines by incorporating target keywords and ensuring the text is structured for better visibility and ranking.\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to harness the power of LM Studio and Chain of Thought reasoning to create high-quality blog content efficiently. This approach not only saves time but also improves the quality and coherence of the final output, making it more engaging and valuable to readers."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Step 1: Install required libraries (if not already installed)\n","%pip install requests"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Step 2: Import necessary libraries\n","import requests"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Step 3: Define connection details to your local LM Studio server\n","LM_STUDIO_URL = \"http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Step 4: Function to generate content using LM Studio\n","def generate_content(prompt, max_tokens=100, temperature=0.7, model=\"lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf\"):\n","    headers = {\n","        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n","    }\n","    payload = {\n","        \"model\": model,\n","        \"messages\": [\n","            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n","        ],\n","        \"max_tokens\": max_tokens,\n","        \"temperature\": temperature,\n","    }\n","    \n","    try:\n","        response = requests.post(LM_STUDIO_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)\n","        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n","        \n","        result = response.json()\n","        return result['choices'][0]['message']['content']\n","    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n","        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","        return \"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Step 5: Select a topic and generate an outline\n","topic = \"The Benefits of Remote Work\"\n","outline_prompt = f\"Create an outline for a blog on {topic}.\"\n","outline = generate_content(outline_prompt)\n","print(\"Outline:\")\n","print(outline)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Step 6: Generate content for each section of the outline\n","sections = outline.split('\\n')\n","blog_content = \"\"\n","\n","for section in sections:\n","    if section.strip():\n","        section_prompt = f\"Write a detailed paragraph for the section: {section}\"\n","        section_content = generate_content(section_prompt, max_tokens=300)\n","        blog_content += f\"{section}\\n{section_content}\\n\\n\"\n","\n","print(\"Generated Blog Content:\")\n","print(blog_content)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Step 7: Refine and proofread the generated content\n","refine_prompt = f\"Refine and proofread the following blog content:\\n{blog_content}\"\n","refined_content = generate_content(refine_prompt, max_tokens=500)\n","print(\"Refined Blog Content:\")\n","print(refined_content)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Step 8: SEO optimization\n","seo_prompt = f\"Optimize the following blog content for SEO.
